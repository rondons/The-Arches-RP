Beastmen's skin, hair and eye colour are as varied as those found all over nature.

## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Animal Tribes
Most free beastmen live in tribes, where everyone tends to have a similar mutation. Outliers do exist and appear over time, but beastmen children tend to mostly resemble or possess the mutations of their parents.
The beastmen tribes often follow a lifestyle to do with the creature they resemble. A lynx tribe might prowl and hunt at night; a wolf tribe will hunt and chase in group; and a deer tribe will be mostly vegetarian. 

### Slaves of the Spiral
In most of the Central Spiral, beastmen are seen as an inferior race. They are the most common type of slave for anyone to own; with strong beastmen often labouring for their masters, and perceptive ones being treated like hunting dogs. 
Most beastmen who live has slaves have grown accostumed to this way of life, but that doesn't mean there isn't an occasional revolt!

### Gaia's Guidance
Beastmen are usualy very well attuned to nature, and its common that they pray to Gaia. Priests and healers within beastmen tribes are usually followers of Gaia, and even in servitude they tend to follow Gaia.
Some beastmen say they can even feel Gaia itself whenever they are out by nature; in the trees or grass.
