## Overview 

### Average Lifespan
Echoes have a long lifespan, living for about 100 to 200 years in a mobile state and reaching maturity at around 50 years of age.
Echoes don't reproduce like most creatures. They create spores which they just release into the air over time. Each spore can theoretically create another Echo, but most spores die before they can create an Echo, and even those that do usually have the Echo die mere moments after being created. Because of this, Echoes are a rare sight.

### Average Appearance
In their early stages of life, Echoes typically resemble the creature they reanimated, and the more time that passes the more floral that creature resembles, and the more features it loses from the original host. After they fully mature, Echoes resemble floral bipedal creatures with as many colours as fungi can have, with big eyes, long slender arms and legs, as well as digits, and often times possessing hardened spots, particularly on their back. At this stage, Echoes tend to be between 5 to 8 feet tall. 
At the end of their mobile state, Echoes tend to more so resemble a jumble of spores and fungi.

## Society and Lifestyle

### Echo of Another Life
Echoes live because other creatures died. When a spore of an echo lands on a mostly-intact corpse of a sentient creature, it takes root within the creature and reanimates it. Initially, the Echo simply believes they are the creature, keeping their same memories, ideals, and thoughts but with serious gaps in what they remember. They might be confused as to what happened to them, or seek help, at which point they are often discovered as Echoes.
Echoes keep the skills that their host had, but their bodies grow cold and are no longer as responsive as they once were.
It is unclear if an Echo merely mimics the host's mind, or if it actually is the host's mind taking new form. All magic capable of clarifying such things makes it seem as if they are the one and the same entity, so that is the running consensus, and why Echoes are so widely accepted. They are treated as miracles, as divine acts that brought a creature back when they should have died, to fulfill some divine purpose.

### Two Minds
As Echoes grow and start to mature, they start struggling more and more often with problems of identity and they develop a desire to leave the area their host lived in, and a sensation that they must accept the reality of what they are. Most tend to become more calm and less prone to emotion, shunning away the person they used to be, while a few others tend to cling to the creature they were and develop bizarre overcompensations (such as dressing up exceedingly "human-like"). Some Echoes even do both periodically, like a moody teenager. 
While these usually die down as an Echo matures and all semblance to the original host is lost, they tend to develop this semblance of the personality that they were originally. They carry out conversations with this personality, which they do so audibly despite it taking place within their minds.
Loved ones of the host often struggle a bit with this phase, as it marks a shift from the Echoes acting like their host, and self-internalizing what they really are, and moving on from their old life. 

### Return to Gaia
A few years after they mature, Echoes will seek for a perfect spot to take root in. Even as they travel they might keep one or two spots in mind that interest them.
At the end of their mobile state, Echoes' try to return to one of these places to take root in as it becomes harder for them to move. Once they root themselves, their bodies unfurl and they become a colony of fungi in the area. Eventually, their consciousness fades, and they become part of the world's flora, technically alive, but no longer sentient.

## Echoes Traits

### Fungal Bodies
Echoes slowly repair their bodies overtime and can shrug off damage that their hosts never could, and they can also create fungal plates to protect especially delicate or soft areas in their bodies. Headshots and damage to vital areas does not kill Echoes. Atop of that, they have minor resistance (DR 1) against physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, slashing).

### Empathic Field
Most people feel at ease around Echoes and even prone to agreeing to what they say. This is often a subtle effect, but it keeps most family members from attacking them when they realize their dead loved one came back to life. You can use your Heritage as a +3 Trait on all social rolls. 

### Strange Minds
Echoes possess a high degree of empathy. Not only can they peer into the minds of their past hosts, but sometimes they can peer into the minds of others.
You gain the ability to communicate telepathically with another creature within medium range / 60 feet of you. You don't need to see it, but must be aware it is there. If you share a language, you can communicate freely, but if not, then you can only communicate simple ideas back and fourth. You can also share sensations or general feelings through this telepathy.
You also gain the ability to blast the mind of a creature you can see within 60 feet / medium range of you, dealing stunning damage.
You also gain the ability to peer into the mind of a creature you can see within 60 feet / medium range of you, reading their innermost thoughts and getting a sense of how they feel about you or about one subject of your choice. Once you use this ability once, any subsequent uses cause you to take 1d4 Corruption. This is reset at the end of a Rest.
Finally, you gain minor resistance (DR 1) against mental damage (stunning, confusing, frightening).

### Fire Vulnerability
Echoes are particularly vulnerable to fire. They have Major Vulnerability against Fire (taking double damage from it).
