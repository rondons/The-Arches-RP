Bardagi possess thick bones, which often protrude from spots along their skin. Most often this appens on their shoulders, knuckles and near their spine. They also often possess tusks.
Bardagi's skin colours varies from pale gray, to dark, to a pasty tan, to a deep dark blue or green. They rarely have beards, but when they do, they match their hairs' colours, which range from a deep dark black, to gray, to red and green.

## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Thrill of Combat
Bardagi society is molded by confrontation. They are wired to enjoy it and due to their regeneration and resilience, random scuffles are little more than a daily inconvenience. They look at pain and physical combat as a therapeutic activity, and a far better one than endlessly debating on a topic. If a Bardagi believes in something, they should back that up by winning  a combat due to it or for it.
This doesn't mean Bardagi often kill one another, afterall, if they kill someone that means they only get to fight once. If they leave them alive, they can fight many times. There is also a kinship that forms between Bardagi when they fight an oponent that truly is trying. Cowards, however, tend to get no such mercy. Bardagi will also happily kill those that pose a direct threat to them.

### Culture of Respect
Its not uncommon for Bardagi to disagree on a topic, but even when they do they tend to follow those they respect. A leader that has proved their bravery and combat prowess can lead hundreds of Bardagi to their death, while those in dishonor are often shunned by their society as a whole, even if they are wealthy or famous.

### No Honor in Magic
It is said that Bardagi were created during the War in Heaven by Belicar; who saw them as their children, and who often blessed them with His power while other Chapters and Principles ignored them. 
For this reason, magic users are usually frowned upon in Bardagi society, except for those that take on Belicar's favours. There are a few exceptions to this. Special priests chosen by Belicar are allowed to learn the magic of one of the other Chapters, becoming more so religious figures within the community than mages. These few are often looked at with a mixture of reverence and suspicion.

## **Bardagi Traits**

### Students of War
Bardagi are specially adept at learning new combat techniques and weapons. They gain an extra +1 Training Point whenever they learn a Narrow or Broad skill that directly relates to combat or war in some way.

### Tough as Nails
Bardagi are incredibly hard to put down.

Once they use this, they can't do so again until they finish a Rest.
Furthermore, Bardagi gain +2 Health Maximum, which can apply past the normal health cap. (Meaning a Bardagi can feasably start with 22 Health)
