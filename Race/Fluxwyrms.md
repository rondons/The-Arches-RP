## Overview 

### Average Lifespan
Fluxwyrms have a short lifespan, living for about 40 years and reaching maturity at around 16 years of age.
Fluxwyrms have a gestational period of only two months and usually have between 2 to 6 children.  

### Average Appearance
Fluxwyrms are of typically short stature, ranging between 3 feet to a little over 4 feet. 
Born of chaos and mutation, Fluxwyrms resemble chimeras, as if someone grabbed a bunch of animals and molded them into a humanoid frame. They can have pincers for hands, rat tails and dog muzzles, all the while covered in thick fur or scales. Whats more is that the appearance of a Fluxwyrm, as their name implies, is constantly changing, often to match their current environment.

## Society and Lifestyle

### Shunned by the Arches
Its said that Fluxwyrms were born out of the chaos of the War in Heaven. Most of society in the Central Spiral, and even a great deal of the Twilight Realms, hate Fluxwyrms and consider them to be pests, treated even below slaves with some kingdoms outright exterminating them or barring them from entry altogether.
Because of this, most Fluxwyrms either live exclusively with their kind, or must learn to tolerate constant abuse while trying to make ends meet in any other society. They tend to find their niche in highly dangerous jobs that would kill any other race, as hunters, or as apprentices or helpers to mages who invoke the more dangerous aspects of Chapters.
Because of the constant insults they suffer, and with how negatively they are seen by most societies, most Fluxwyrms grow to hate every other race, or themselves- sometimes both.

### Backstabbers and Cowards
Fluxwyrms don't just have problems with other races. Their distrust for others and their abuse has become ingrained in their culture. Fluxwyrms just have an instinct to take whatever they can from life, at whatever cost, and they have a strong self-preservation sense too. They will cheat, backstab, rob or even murder other Fluxwyrms if it furthers their interests, and because they will do just that, they rarely trust another Fluxwyrm too.
Many societies of Fluxwyrms collapsed not by an enemy's hand, but because the inner turmoil and fighting sundered it appart. 
It's safe to say that whenever they're called to do something dangerous, most Fluxwyrms will avoid it at all costs and send someone else whenever they can, while actively ignoring the lives of those beneath them in Fluxwyrm hierarchy.

### Cult of Principles
Fluxwyrms are one of the races that stands to benefit the most if Helios' lost its power and the Central Spiral ceased to be. Because of this, many of the Fluxwyrms worship Principles rather than Chapters, and in particular the Principle of Ruina. This practice is highly illegal in the Central Spiral, so those that inhabit it often conduct these prayers and offering in secret. It is not uncommon for these cults to grow over time until a large underground cult exists in secret, often with the aim to topple the society in the name of all Fluxwyrms.

## Fluxwyrm Traits

### Natural Cleansing
Fluxwyrms were born from corruption and, unlike every other race, have a way to deal with it. As a Fluxwyrm, you can spend 1 DT action to flush your body of corruption, and remove 1 permanent point of it.

### Adaptive Bodies
Being creatures of chaos, Fluxwyrms' bodies automatically adapt to the dangers around them. This also makes them extraordinarily hard to kill. Whenever you enter a new environment, or whenever you take damage, you can chose to trigger an adaptation. 

You can have a total of 3 adaptations at the same time, chosing which one(s) you lose when you trigger a new one.

If the adaptation is triggered by damage, it will only go into effect after the damage has already been taken.

If the adaptation was triggered by physical or elemental damage, you can gain Major Resistance against that damage type as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by internal damage, you can gain immunity to the type of attack that caused it as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by entering a dark environment, you can gain the ability to see well in low-light as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by entering an environment with taint, decay or corruption, you can gain immunity to that effect as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by entering any kind of environment, you can gain natural camouflage and can use your Heritage as a +3 Trait on all rolls that benefit from this camouflage as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by entering an environment with difficult terrain, such as thick folliage, a steep incline, or tall buildings, you can gain your Heritage as a +3 Trait to move through this difficult terrain as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by entering a cold, hot, stormy or acidic environment, you can gain your Heritage as a +3 Trait to resist those types of hazards, along with Minor Resistance to the relevant damage type as an adaptation.
If the adaptation was triggered by being submerged in a liquid, you can gain the ability to breathe in that liquid as an adaption.

Your GM can allow for other triggers or effects if they make sense.

### Flux Immunities
Fluxwyrms were born in filth and their bodies automatically adapt to a variety of threats. They are immune to poison in all forms and they can eat and drink spoiled or poisoned food and water without any adverse effect.
