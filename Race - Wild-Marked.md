### Average Lifespan
Wild-Marked have an average lifespan, living for about 70 years and reaching maturity at around 18 years of age.
Wild-Marked have a gestational period of 6 months and usually have between 1 to 4 children.

### Average Appearance  
Wild-Marked are shapechangers by nature, but they usually look either like humans, favoured, bardagi, or beastmen. The one constant that they have is their Wild-Mark from which they get their name. The Wild-Mark is a tattoo-like symbol that a Wild-Marked is born with, which can be anywhere on their bodies, from their palms to their foreheads. It is usually dark in coloration: in a shaded of purple, dark blue, or black, and its the one part of the Wild-Marked that can never shift. It is usually the size of their palm.
Wild-Marked have an average height between 5 and 7 feet.
There's little difference between Wild-Marked women and men, except that males tend to have broader shoulders. They can both easily pass off as either gender.

## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Children of Fallen Chapters
It is said that Wild-Marked were created during the War in Heaven as weapons against Helios and the other Chapters by those on the side of the Principles, thus the reason they can appear to look like any other race. Because of this, most Wild-Marked are treated as second class citizens and openly despised or thought of as duplicitous, and are some of the most commonly enslaved races in the Central Spiral as well.
Wild-Marked themselves struggle with their very nature, believing that their own race is some sort of aberration that should not exist, or that has yet to fully redeem itself for what part it played in the War in Heaven.

### Dutiful Aspirations
Despite popular belief that Wild-Marked are duplicitous, most of them are incredibly loyal and dutiful, following the orders of those they see as superiors or leaders without question. Most Wild-Marked that became more than nobodies, did so by becoming agents under a powerful entity or even a Sun King. Their loyalty and inherent abilities make them inherently capable hunters, spies and even assassins.
Most Wild-Marked see performing their duties well as the best way to prove themselves and to climb in life; be it either to gain respect they seek or simply better living conditions.

### Orderly Rituals
Wild-Marked have a great tendency for order and structure. They enjoy having rules by which to guide themselves. Even the more disconnected of Wild-Marked who live as hunters tend to establish certain rituals that they follow almost religiously. This could be as simple as waiting for the sunset each day before a meal, to an intricate ritual they perform every morning.
This propension to create rituals is often inherently linked with their ability to shapechange. Wild-Marked create rituals that make sense to them and which allow them to temporarily gain the appearance or abilities of creatures they have seen.

## Wild-Marked Traits

### Wild-Mark
The Wild-Mark is the source of a Wild-Marked's power; often appearing as a Tattoo-like-symbol. It is commonly present along the arms, on the chest, or on the back of the neck of a Wild-Marked. As a Wild-Marked, you gain one such Wild-Mark.
Your Wild-Mark is particularly vulnerable. If it is directly impaired in any way (if it suffers from a Flaw), the impairment applies to a Wild-Marked's abilities. A Wild-Mark can usually hold 5 Mark Points at any given time, with a simple flaw making it able to only hold 3, and a Traumatic only able to hold 1.
Whenever you perform a Wild-Marked Ritual, your Wild-Mark will need to be exposed for the duration of said Ritual.


### Ritual of Change
Wild-Marked can spend an hour to take on the apperance of a humanoid race they have studied and know. Their height does not change, and the Wild-Mark can never be hidden, but everything else in their bodies shifts and changes so they appear as the new race. They might grow tusks and horns to appear as a Bardagi, or a lynx's tail and ears to appear as a beastmen. This costs 2 Mark Points.
Alternatively, if a Wild-Marked has studied a particular individual, they can shapechange directly into their apperance. This change is often imperfect, getting better with how much a Wild-Marked knows them personally. If they simply talked in passing or are acquaintances, the resemblance will only be good enough for a coursory glance or when seen at a distance. If the Wild-Marked knows their target more intimately, this might even fool their friends. This costs 3 Mark Points.

### Ritual of Adaptation
Wild-Marked are capable survivalists. They can spend an hour performing a ritual to adapt their bodies to the current environmental conditions. They gain Minor Resistance to the effects of the local weather and can use their heritage as a +3 on all rolls regarding their survival in their current environment. This costs 1 Mark Points.

### Ritual of Power
Wild-Marked possess the uncany ability to extract and mimic the abilities of other creatures. At any point, a Wild-Marked can spend an hour performing a ritual to swap what abilities they have active.
Wild-Marked start off with four abilities they have learned (you can pick from those below). To learn additional abilities, a Wild-Mark must slay a creature with an ability they covet, extract the organ which they believe is the source, and study it with a DT Action. The GM might dictate a given creature requires more than one DT Action if they are particularly complex or their ability is hard to replicate, and the abilities Wild-Marked gain might also be toned down (such as a basilisk's gaze allowing them to temporarily petrify rather than permanently).
