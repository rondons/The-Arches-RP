## Overview

### Average Lifespan
Mechanids live very long lives, capable of enduring for centuries without much physical change. Most do start rusting and breaking down after just a handful of years without maintenance though, but the longest living ones have over a milenia.
Similarly, mechanids don't really have an age of maturity. They rarely change just by the passage of time.
Mechanids don't exactly reproduce like most living organisms. Skilled artificers can often create one in just over a year, but before they can become sentient, at least a decade has to pass.

### Average Appearance
Mechanids are as varied as it can get. They can resemble hulking golems with claws or small rectangular creatures that practically blend into the shadows. They can easily range from anywhere between 2 feet and 12 feet tall.
The most common distinguishing in mechanid appearance has to do with the purpose they were built for. Vanguard mechanids are often armored and have natural weapons as part of their bodies, while Envoy mechanids often have a more astetically pleasing looks and might even appear Human or Favoured.

## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Life before the Awakening
Mechanids don't start out their life as sentient creatures. They're often built for a purpose that they dutifully fulfill for years. Over time, their minds are warped and shaped out of the singular purpose they follow, and at some point they just awaken. Most mechanids remember this moment well, with everything before in their life being fuzzy, with centuries blending together before their awakening. Some even refer to this period as a long dream. Still, even if they don't fully remember it, the life of a mechanid before their awakening often shapes them. If they were treated poorly they might have a disdain for the race that did so, while if they were kept in dirty environments to the point it often rusted them, they might develop neatfreak personalities. 
  
### Prime Directive
Most mechanids are driven to try to find their purpose in life. Most believe there was a reason for them to awaken, be it the work of a Chapter, providence, or the world itself needing them for some purpose. A gardener mechanid might find consciousness just after its garden was burnt down, and decide they woke up to exact vengeance upon those willing to harm nature; another might wake up alone and decide their purpose is to travel and find companionship. Whatever it is, most mechanids are pretty attached to their prime directive, letting it be the center of their moral compass and a guide to their actions. Because of this, many mechanids are seen as unwavering or even fanatical in their beliefs.

### The Electric Constellation
Many mechanids relate having seen a strange Electric Constellation in the dreams of the life before the awakening. A strange universe of interconnected stars of electricity with millions of mechanids all in eternal joy. Some mechanids relate even having visions of this Constellation whenever they meditate, or are in an unconscious state.
The Electric Constellation is a source for many a debate, with most mechanids believing it is some form of afterlife they are aspiring to. Some make it their prime directive to discover more about it, or to try to reach it.

## Mechanid Traits

### Mechanid Resilience
Many mechanids have little to not biological parts in their bodies. This makes them incredibly resilient to poison. Mechanids have major resistance to poison, and if they get a roll to resist being poisoned, it counts as Supernatural to them.
Mechanids are immune to all disease that is not specifically targeted at them.
Furthermore, mechanids don't need to eat or drink, but they require some form of sustenance. This can either be as simple as needing to be under Helios' light for at least an hour per week, to as obscure as consuming a special brand of crystals at least once a month.

### Optimized Rest
Despite their nature, sentient mechanids still enter a sleep-like state where they dream, but they need only 4 hours of rest per night. In a Rest, they get a bit more time to perform light activity and gain an additional Downtime Action on each Rest they can use to craft an item, seek an asset, repair themselves, or work on a long-term goal. This extra action is done at a -5 penalty (if a roll is required). 

### Electrical Vulnerability
Due to their nature, mechanids are majorly vulnerable to lightning (taking double damage from it).

### Mechanical Components
Mechanids possess mechanical components based on what they were made to be. The following are the most common types of mechanids:

###### - Envoy:
Often designed to partake in social interactions, envoys are often astetically pleasing and can use their heritage as a +3 for any sort of social interaction and for trying to read others emotions and thoughts.
Envoys also gain +4 Trait points they can spend on either languages or narrow social skills.

###### - Specialist:
Specialists were designed with a certain function in mind. They can be artisans, healers, cobblers, etc. They can use their heritage as a +3 trait for the trade or function they were designed for.
Specialists also gain an integrated tool or kit based on their function that just becomes a part of them. This doesn't weight anything, and if the tool would be limited in uses (like a healer's kit) then they can use it twice, recovering the uses at the end of a Long rest. Finally, the integrated tool also counts as masterwork (+3).

###### - Vanguard:
Vanguards are resilient and tough, made to be the perfect balance between offense and defense. They can use their heritage as a +3 trait for all things combat and war related. 
Vanguards possess integrated Melee weapons that count as fine (+2).
Finaly, Vanguards have integrated Light, Medium or Heavy armour that, if it breaks, they regain or recover at the end of a Rest.

###### - Scout:
Built to evade and scout out locations, scouts are lean and nimble. They can use their heritage as a +3 trait for stealth and speed.
Scouts also have a cloaking ability that turns them invisible for a cumulative 2 minutes. They can turn this invisibility on or off at will, regaining the 2 minutes at the end of a Rest.

###### - Artillery:
Artillery mechanids possess some ancient artifact mounted into their bodies that they cannot be disarmed of, that is always attuned to them, and that doesn't count against your total number of attunements. This is a Moderate Artifact, with 3 Artifact Points. You can pick the power(s) your artifact has from the list below:

You can upgrade any of the Artifacts that cost 1 Artifact Point and can be used only once per Rest, to at-will by spending 3 Artifact Points on them instead.

Power | Cost | Description
-|-|-
Mounted Taser | 1 | Whenever you perform a melee attack, you can make the damage of the attack Lightning damage.

The railgun is considered to be Artillery (has Devastating and Armour Penetration x2) and deals piercing damage.
Wave-Clearer | 1 | You can activate this ability once, recovering it at the endof a Rest. When you do so, you shoot several projectiles in a 60-foot cone originating from you. Your projectiles deal piercing damage.
Mounted Mortar | 1 | You can activate this ability once, recovering it at the end of a Rest. When you do so, you shoot an explosive. These explosives can fly out up to 150 feet / long range and when they land they explode in a 5-foot radius, dealing fire damage. The Mounted Mortar is considered to be Artillery (has Devastating and Armour Penetration x2) but also has an -5 penalty to the roll whenever used.
Propulsion Engines | 1 | You can activate this ability once, recovering it at the end of a Rest. When you do so, for the next 10 minutes, you can hover, glide and jump 15 feet (5 meters) in the air effortlessly.
Helios Sun Canon | 3 | You can activate this ability once, recovering it at the end of a Rest. When you do so, you pick a point within 150 feet / Long Range that is exposed to the open air or from where Helios is visible. A blast of light rains from above, hitting everything in a 15-foot radius column with potent fire damage. The Sun Canon is considered to be Artillery (has Devastating and Armour Penetration x2).
Ouranos' Aegis | 3 | Any creature within 30 feet / melee range of you is protected by your Aegis, gaining DR 1 against any physical damage sources originating outside of your Aegis' range. You also gain this benefit and can shorten the range of your Aegis at-will.
Gaia's Aegis | 3 | You can activate this ability once, recovering it at the end of a Rest. For the next minute, any creature of your choice within 30 feet / melee range of you, recovers 1d4 health per each few moments that passes (15 seconds).
