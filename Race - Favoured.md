## Overview 

### Average Lifespan
Favoured have a long lifespan, living for about 800 years and reaching maturity at around 100 years of age.
Favoured have a gestational period of 2 years and usually have only 1 child.

### Average Appearance  
Favoured are similar to humans in many ways and their overall appearance resembles them, except they are considered to be a step closer to the divine. Their proportions and the shape of their bodies and face conventionally attractive while their hairs, eyes and the bends of their body are naturally discolorated and bland when they're born. These last set of features changes wildly from Favoured to Favoured, becoming representative of the Chapter they grow to embody. A Favoured might have fiery, orange hair and glowing digits, while another might have frost covering their elbows and deep piercing blue eyes.
Favoured have an average height, between a little under 5 feet to a little over 7 feet.

## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Descendants of Gods
While other races might have a particular connection with a given Chapter or Principle, Favoured are considered direct descendants from them. Mortal, yet with a portion of the divine within them. For this, they are revered and well-respected by many societies in the Central Spiral, though quite a few others, particularly outside of Helios' light, would rather sacrifice them and use their bodies in rituals and potions.
Being so close to the Chapters, most Favoured claim to be able to feel the power or will of the one closest to them; with some claiming to feel Helios' will in the sunlight, or Selene's thoughts in their dreams.

### Apotheotic Childhood
When young, Favoured look pretty similar to one another and lack the vibrant features resemblant of their closest Chapter. They tend to spend most of their childhood trying to discover who their parentage is through rituals, pilgrimages, and meditation. This doesn't mean they don't act like other children, but a sense of identity and belonging is often central to every Favoured.
As a Favoured discovers who their closest Chapter is, and thus their parentage, they often take on a powerful boon from them, at which point their features develop around this boon and their bodies become living artifacts. An example of this would be a Favoured taking on a boon of Helios, which allows them to set fire to things and shed light, which could cause their hair to become living flames, and their fingers to glow red hot. The same Chapter, with a slightly different boon allowing the Favoured to just shed light but quite blinding light, could just have their hair glow a gorgeous gold and white, with their bodies shining bright whenever they cast.
Some Favoured chose to renounce their closest Chapter, accepting then the embrace of another. Some other Favoured simply have two closest Chapters to them. When this happens, their features often take a mix of the two parental Chapters. This also creates a divided Favoured, who will likely struggle with their identity.

### Hunted and Revered
Favoured are not just capable of invoking the power of Chapters more easily than most. Their bodies are true living artifacts! When a Favoured matures (usually at around 100 years of age), their very bodies becoming infused with the power of their closest Chapter. For this, many Favoured outside the Central Spiral are hunted. If someone can extract this power from their bodies, they'll be able to command it. This is also the reason why Favoured are highly sought after whenever someone wants to make a sacrificial ritual. Similarly, many others avoid killing Favoured, even in war, for doing so is often considered a slight to their closest Chapter. Most Favoured also avoid killing one another, particularly if their closest Chapter is the same.
Because of their nearly divine status and their long-lasting lives, Favoured tend to view themselves above all other races in the Central Spiral, with the lives of others meaning less in their eyes.

## Favoured Traits

### Divine Heritage
Chose a Chapter/Principle to be your Divine Heritage. Your heritage counts as a +3 Trait for all rolls regarding that Chapter/Principle.
Alternatively, you can pick a dual Divine Heritage, chosing two Chapters/Principles. Your heritage counts as a +2 Trait for all rolls regarding both those Chapter/Principles
Finally, you gain an equivalent amount of extra Trait Points equal to your Trait Bonus that you can spend solely on your given Divine Heritage.

### Divine Communion
As attuned as they are with their closest Chapter, Favoured learn to read their will, and extrapolate ideas from it. A Favoured of Ouranos reading the winds, a Favoured of Helios might read the heat in the air, etc. 
You can ask your Divine Heritage up to two questions, regaining the number of uses spent at the end of a Rest. 50% of the time, the GM must offer a truthful reply in the name of the Divine Heritage, which your character will interpret, which might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. 
You can increase the percentage to 75% by performing a 10 minute ritual with an offering symbolic to your Divine Heritage.
The communion doesnâ€™t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome. Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the Chapter's knowledge. Your Divine Heritage will also refuse to answer or might even offer purposefully wrong answers towards anything that would actively go against its interests.
Favoured with a dual Divine Heritage might have both their heritages respond at the same time, or have only one respond, at the GM's discretion.

### Living Artifact
Your body becomes a Moderate Artifact of your chosen Divine Heritage that is always attuned to you (but doesn't count as one of your attunement slots) and that can never be disarmed from you while you are alive.
Unlike most Artifacts, this one can be slowly improved over time, counting as if you were training a Broad skill. Each time you do so, it gains one more artifact point for you to spend.
Every time you train your body in this way, you must train some other Broad Trait before being able to do so again.
