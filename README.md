Bardagi (meaning Lovers of Battle) 
Tall, brutish but powerful creatures, favoured by the Chapter of Belicar (essentially god of war). They live to fight and are excellent at it. Come in flavours of how they prefer to fight, with some being methodical and smart, while others being hulking infectious monsters. 

Beastmen 
Creatures who seem like they are part beast with permanent mutations. Your cat girls, wolf boys, rat people. Echoes Psyonic fungi creatures that take over the corpses of the dead and reanimate them, using them as shells of themselves and rebuilding from there. Wildly empathic and often charismatic. Some people hate them. 

Favoured
Long-living beautiful creatures who are part Relic. They have a Relic of the Chapters as part of their biology and identity, and are in tune with the old world and the Chapters themselves. They consider themselves favoured by them, thus their name. They don't necessarily need to look like actual elves, but they are all gorgeous and have some strange features like their parent Chapter. A Favoured of Helius might have a fiery crown and wings, a Favoured of Gaia might have roots protruding from her hair and back that link themselves with plants around her. 

Fluxwyrms 
Created in the great War in Heaven. These are the ultimate survivors. They are creatures immune to decay, poison and resistant to most things. Their bodies automatically adapt to any present danger. They look like some ungodly amalgamation of nature though, with some looking similar to beastmen, while others appearing quite chimeric. If they are in darkness, their eyes adapt. If they are pushed underwater, they gain gills. If they are in a jungle, they gain a tail or have stronger hands to climb- etc 

Humans 
Humans are humans. They are smart and learn faster 

Mechanids 
Mechanical creatures of old that attained sentience. Many dream of eletric dreams, feeling a great beyond just beyond their reach. An ancient network just out of their hands... many seek it, while others search for purpose. These are essentially androids. 

Wild-Marked Creatures marked by nature but with some control over their nature. Through rituals or digestion, they can alter how their bodies flow and web with the natural world, changing their abilities and forms. They're essentially mutants with power over how their mutations work.
