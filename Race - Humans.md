## **Society and Lifestyle**  

### Curious Childhood
As children, humans are particularly helpless. Only at around 12 years of age are they able to weakly defend themselves. Most of these early years are spent curiously discovering the world and learning. They then spend most of their adulthood working on a singular trade, perfecting it until retirement or death.  
  
### Ambition for more  
Most humans are pretty ambitious, seeking to better their lives at any cost. Their position within their society, their wealth, and their influence often dictates their social status. Because of this, human societies often have class systems and humans regularly compete for wealth, title or influence, sometimes in very subtle ways, but other times outright wars are waged in the name of greed for power.

### Social Creatures
